This document describes how to configure all the required software for CIlib and the
CILib website in Windows 7. It includes details for users with proxy settings and for
users that do not require proxy access.

## GIT

### Downloading and installing Git
Download Git from [Git](http://git-scm.com/download).

Make sure that you select: Run Git from Windows Command Prompt while installing.

Open command line (Start > cmd).

Configure git with name and address:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name" 
    git config --global user.email your@email.address

Test with: git --version.

### Github

Resister an account with [Github](https://github.com/).


### Getting the source code

Go to the [CIlib Repository](https://github.com/cilib/cilib) and click on Fork located 
on the top right.

### Cloning the Repository

If you are working with a proxy, you need to configure the proxy settings. To do that
type the following line onto command line:

    git config --global http.proxy http://username:password@proxy:port

To clone a repository tye the following:

    git clone URLFromGitHub nameOfFolderToCloneTo

Add the CIlib repository as an upstream remote repository:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/cilib/cilib.git

For instructions on how to use Git you may access the [documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation)

## Netbeans and Scala plugin

Follow the instructions listed in Step 1 found at: 
[Getting Started](http://cilib.net/2012/07/18/netbeans-cilib-and-sbt/).
Make sure that you have the latest version of Netbeans to avoid running 
into trouble (At the time that this was documented Netbeans 7.2 was used).

## SBT

Download the .msi provided here: [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

Right click on Computer > Properties > Advanced Settings > Environment Variables.
Add the following to your user variable: path, where ~ is the path to the sbt.bat:

    ~/sbt.bat

- If the System path variable also exists, only add ~ to the it.

Go to the folder: C:\Users\YourUser\.sbt.

Create the folder "plugins" if it does not exist.

Inside this folder create the file plugins.sbt if it does not exist.

Add the following to the file and save it (note the empty lines in between):

    resolvers += ScalaToolsSnapshots

    resolvers += "remeniuk repo" at "http://remeniuk.github.com/maven"

    libraryDependencies += "org.netbeans" %% "sbt-netbeans-plugin" % "0.1.4"

If there is a proxy, find the sbt.bat file located in the cilib folder and type:

    -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy -Dhttp.proxyPort=port -Dhttp.proxyUser=username -Dhttp.proxyPassword=password

- between "%_JAVACMD%" and %_JAVA_OPTS% which are found after ":run".

Open command line and type:

    sbt

Then type:

    netbeans

Navigate to your cilib folder if not already there and use the following to compile:

    sbt compile

Use the following to build the project

    sbt assembly

Follow the instructions described in Step 4 [here](http://cilib.net/docs/dev/getting-started.html). 
Note that the instructions are for linux, so replace simulator.sh with simulator.bat.
Note that the command line instruction "export" is for linux users, the windows user may set the
path environment variable if they want.  The "chmod" and "export" instructions are not necessary,
unless the user wants to be able to call simulator.bat from any folder in the computer, so one
may skip this.

Use the following to run simulations, where xml has the configuration of the experiments:

    simulator.bat simulator/xml/ga.xml

Follow the instructions listed in Step 4 found at:
